## **Overview**

Our project aims to create a realistic simulation of butterfly flights and behaviors using WebGPU. The method we are using relies on the aerodynamic-based CFD solver, which guarantees realistic results, while using a hierarchical rigged skeleton to increase the performance so that it can run in realtime. 

## **Milestone 1**

Slide: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D0KU-Wp5UGeHj1HUCtebzcEjDT0gydEKm9OTPFgEmzs/edit#slide=id.g18fde25b9ae_9_0

Progress:
- Rigged butterfly mesh and example animation
- WebGPU cube instance rendering
- Basic GLTF render pipeline and orbit camera
- Basic HTML UI

Next step:
- Approach the author
- Combine features in milestone 1
- GLTF texture and animation support
- Implement full content from the reference paper including force simulation and maneuvering control
- More robust UI
